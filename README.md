# orienda_agent

Our mobile application allows agents to pre-register patients for hospital check-ups by filling out basic information including first name, last name, phone number, date of birth, and a brief description of the patient's condition. Upon submission, the app automatically generates a report that the agent can access for each registered patient. This streamlines the check-up process and improves the efficiency of the agent's work while reducing waiting times for patients. The app offers significant benefits to agents by automating the pre-registration and report generation processes, allowing them to manage their patient's check-ups more effectively on the go
